Prediction of in-hospital patient survival

Predictors of in-hospital mortality in admitted patients remain poorly characterized. Our objective is to develop and validate a model for predicting all-cause hospital mortality in admitted patients.

Then, we will create a web-based mortality risk prediction application, primarily for health care personnel, to facilitate better management of admitted patients.
